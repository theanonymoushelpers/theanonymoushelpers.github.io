    "qu": "If you were to look at a population pyramid that sorts by age, what would be a sign of low life expectancy?",
    "a1": "Wide base, wide top",

    "ans": 3,
    "timeUpper": 15,
    "timeMid": 23,
    "timeLower": 30,
    "solution": "A wide base indicates many children being born, and a narrow base indicates that many of those children are not able to live long lifespans due to low life expectancy."
},
{
    "qu": "If you were to look at a population pyramid that sorts by age, what would be a sign of high life expectancy?",
    "a1": "Wide base, wide top",
    "a2": "Narrow base, wide top",

{
    "qu": "What is a dependency ratio?",

    "a3": "The number of elderly in a society",
    "a4": "The number of healthy people in a society",
    "ans": 1,
    "timeUpper": 15,
    "timeMid": 23,
    "timeLower": 30,
    "solution": "While elderly people may be dependent, and healthy people may be independent, not all that fall into one of these categories can be categorized as supporting the economy. The ratio determines how many people are supporting the economy in the workforce, versus the number of people dependent on the workforce."
},
{
    "qu": "What does a high dependent population in a country suggest?",
    "a1": "A relatively larger workforce",
    "a2": "A relatively smaller workforce",

    "ans": 2,
    "timeUpper": 15,
    "timeMid": 23,
    "timeLower": 30,
    "solution": "While older people are dependent, longer lifespans are not always correlated, since countries can have a very young population with short lifespans, whom are dependent. The opposite may also be true. Therefore, countries with dependent populations have a smaller workforce to sustain the economy."

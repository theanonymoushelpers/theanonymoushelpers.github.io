            "solution": "`log_2 32` can be written as `log_2 2^5`, which is in the form `log_a b^c`. Anything in this form can be rewritten as `c log_a b, therefore, it can be rewritten as `5 log_2 2`. Adding together `s` and `t`, `s+t=7`."

            "solution": "`ln 81` can be written as `ln 3^4`, which is in the form `log_a b^c`. Anything in this form can be rewritten as `c log_a b, therefore, it can be rewritten as `4 ln 3`. Subtracting `q` from `r`, `q-r=1`."

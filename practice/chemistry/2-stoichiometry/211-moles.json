            "qu": "A compound has a molar mass of `60g/(mol).` If `210g` of this compound is obtained, how many moles were obtained? (do not include units in your answer)",

            "solution": "By using the conversion factor given, we can convert to moles. `210g*(1mol)/(60g)=3.5mol`"

            "timeMid": 15,

            "solution": "First, we need to find the molar mass of `CO_2`, which is around 44g using the periodic table. Then, we can use the conversion factor to convert to moles `176g*(1mol)/(44g)=4mol`"

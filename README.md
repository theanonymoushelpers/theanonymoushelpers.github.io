# TAH-Practice

This is the dev version of The Anonymous Helpers | Practice Mode. The live stable site can be viewed at theanonymoushelpers.github.io

Meet Practice Mode for The Anonymous Helpers. This website will be the framework for our CAS project: to produce free review materials, available to all IB students. We will provide many practice materials, review materials, and articles to help students grasp topics.

Speaking more to the way the website has been built, it will be made using HTML/CSS/JS, with JSON files allowing for easy quiz loading support.

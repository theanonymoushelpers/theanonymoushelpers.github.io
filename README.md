# TAH-Practice

Meet Practice Mode for The Anonymous Helpers. This website will be the framework for our CAS project: to produce free review materials, available to all students. We will provide many practice materials, review materials, and articles to help students grasp topics.

Speaking more to the way the website has been built, it will be made using HTML/CSS/JS, with JSON files allowing for easy quiz loading support.

The website will remain open source, and is unlicensed at this current time, so please do provide credit to us if you plan to use snippets of our code. We currently are not opening up this project to the community to populate the site, however, in the future, if there is such an opportunity, it will be posted in this readme.

# TAH-Practice

Meet Practice Mode for The Anonymous Helpers. This website will be the framework for our CAS project: to produce free review materials, available to all IB students. We will provide many practice materials, review materials, and articles to help students grasp topics.

We are excited to finally open the website to external contributions! While the code remains open-source, do note that questions and content have been provided to The Anonymous Helpers by their respective authors and remain copyrighted by them, which means they may not be used for other purposes. 

By contributing to this project, you grant The Anonymous Helpers the right to use any content you contribute on our website, and you are certifying that the content is solely your own work. As an open-source project, while we can try to assist with copyright claims, you are responsible for enforcing copyright claims if your content is stolen from the website and you wish for it not to be used elsewhere.

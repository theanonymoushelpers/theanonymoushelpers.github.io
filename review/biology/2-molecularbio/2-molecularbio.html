            <h1>2.1 Molecules To Metabolism</h1>
            <p>Chemical elements are the units of pure substance that make up our world. The Earth is composed of about 92 stable elements in all, present in varying quantities<br>99% of living matter consists of just four elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen</p>
            <!--The carbon atom, how it forms stable compounds, and its significance-->
            <h2>The carbon atom, how it forms stable compounds, and its significance</p>
            <p>Atoms combine (or ‘bond’) to form molecules in ways that produce a stable arrangement of electrons in the outer shells of each atom.</p>
            <p>Atoms are most stable when their outer shell of electrons is complete. The first electron shell of an atom can hold up to two electrons and then it is full.</p>
            <p>Covalent bonds are the strongest bonds found in biological molecules. This means they need the greatest input of energy to break them.</p>
            <p>Carbon atoms are able to react with each other to form extended and extremely stable chains.These ‘carbon skeletons’ may be straight chains, branched chains or rings</p>
            <p>The four covalent bonds of carbon atoms point to the corners of a regular tetrahedron (a pyramid with a triangular base).</p>
            <p>Carbon atoms can form more than one bond between them. For example, carbon atoms may share two electrons to form a double bond. Carbon compounds that contain double carbon=carbon bonds are known to chemists as ‘unsaturated’, and carbon compounds containing double bonds are unsaturated compounds. </p>
            <p>All these carbon compounds fit into a relatively small numbers of ‘families’ of compounds. The families are identified by a part of their molecule that is the functional group, which gives them their characteristic chemical properties.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <!--What Is Metabolism?-->
            <h2>What Is Metabolism?</h2>
            <p>Metabolism is the name we give to these chemical reactions of life. The molecules involved are collectively called metabolites.</p>
            <p>Metabolism actually consists of chains (linear sequences) and cycles of enzyme-catalysed reactions, such as we see in respiration, photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and in very many other pathways. </p>
            <p>In anabolic reactions, larger molecules are built up from smaller molecules. Examples of anabolism are the synthesis of proteins from amino acids and the synthesis of polysaccharides from simple sugars. The reactions involved include condensation reactions. In catabolic reactions, larger molecules are broken down. Examples of catabolism are the digestion of complex foods and the breakdown of sugar in respiration. The reactions involved include hydrolysis reaction.</p>
            <p>metabolism = anabolism + catabolism</p>
            <br>
            <!--Metabolism and Energy-->
            <h2>Metabolism and Energy</h2>
            <p>Chemical energy exists in the structure of molecules. Every molecule contains a quantity of stored energy equal to the quantity of energy needed to synthesize it in the first place.</p>
            <p>When glucose is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water in aerobic cell respiration energy is transferred. This energy is no longer in store but is on the move; it is active energy.</p>
            <p>Only part of the stored energy in a molecule is available, known as free energy, and can be used to do work. Reactions that release free energy are known as exergonic reactions. The oxidation of glucose is an example of an exergonic reaction.</p>
            <p>Reactions that require energy are called endergonic reactions. The synthesis of a protein from amino acids is an example of an endergonic reaction.</p>
            <p>The many endergonic reactions that occur in metabolism are made possible by being coupled to exergonic reactions. Coupling occurs through a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).</p>
